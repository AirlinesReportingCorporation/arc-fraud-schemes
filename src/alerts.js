        <p>To address this issue, you should take the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Verify the Authenticity</strong>: Make sure that
            communication claiming to be from Sabre is legitimate. Double-check
            the sender's email address, domain and other identifying
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do Not Click on Suspicious Links</strong>: If you receive
            emails or messages with unfamiliar links or attachments, refrain
            from clicking on them. These could potentially contain malware or
            lead to phishing sites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contact Sabre</strong>: Please reach out to Sabre's official
            contact channels to inform them of the impersonation issue. They may
            have resources and recommendations to address the situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Educate Your Team</strong>: Ensure your team knows about the
            impersonation threat and how to recognize suspicious messages.
            Provide training on email security and best practices for
            identifying phishing attempts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor for Similar Incidents</strong>: Keep an eye out for
            further instances of impersonation and document them. This will help
            in tracking the scope and pattern of the attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Report to Authorities</strong>: If the impersonation
            attempts involve fraudulent activities, consider reporting them to
            relevant authorities or cybersecurity agencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Update Security Protocols</strong>: Review and strengthen
            your organization's email security protocols. This may include
            implementing email filtering, authentication measures and two-factor
            authentication (2FA).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Internal Communication</strong>: Communicate the threat
            within your organization, especially those who handle sensitive
            information or access critical systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Document and Preserve Evidence</strong>: If you suspect
            criminal activity, document evidence related to the impersonation
            attempts, such as email headers, message content and related
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Keep yourself updated on the latest
            security threats and best practices for protecting your organization
            from email impersonation and phishing attacks.

          </p>
        </em>
        <p>
          This inquiry has raised several risk factors that require careful
          consideration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Group Size</strong>: The request involves a
            substantial number of participants, which can pose financial risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of Detailed Contact Information</strong>: The initial
            communication lacks essential contact information, making verifying
            the inquiry's legitimacy difficult.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given these risk factors, we recommend the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification</strong>: Attempt to verify the authenticity of
            the inquiry and the identity of Mr. Carson. Seek additional contact
            information and conduct due diligence on the prospective client.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security Measures</strong>: Strengthen your cybersecurity
            measures to protect sensitive client data and financial
            transactions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We strongly suggest you exercise caution and conduct thorough risk
          assessments before proceeding with this inquiry. The high-risk nature
          of this request necessitates careful consideration to protect your
          company's interests and reputation.

        <p>
          Cybercriminals continue to target the agency community through
          phishing emails, which appear to be from various organizations across
          all business sectors, including GDSs. These emails entice agents to
          click on an embedded link and enter their login credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          No service provider should request login credentials through email. If
          you receive such a request, it is essential to validate it with your
          service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fraudsters can manipulate your reservation systems and cause financial
          harm to your agency if they compromise your credentials. It is
          critical to train your staff to avoid entering their login credentials
          into any links provided in emails and to be vigilant and suspicious of
          any webpage requesting authorization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safeguard your IT environment by implementing policies and procedures
          such as updating passwords and login credentials every 30-90 days and
          validating email senders and hyperlinks before
          clicking and engaging (i.e., opening, forwarding and replying to

        Phishing emails continue to be sent to the travel agency community. The emails contain language to urge the email recipient to click on an embedded link and input their GDS login credentials. Once the user clicks, the GDS credentials are harvested by a fraudster who will gain remote access to the GDS to issue tickets.

        <p>Ensure ALL staff, contractors and outside agents with ticket issuing capability know the phishing emails and the need to safeguard their GDS login credentials.</p>
        <p>GDS providers will never ask agents to log into their system through a link in an email.</p>
        <p>Always log into your GDS through bookmarks in your browser, not through an email link.</p>
